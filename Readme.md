## Advent of Code

## SPOILER ALERT

I added the instructions INCLUDING THE SOLUTIONS (i.e. the output
of my code) to the Readme files of each day.

## What's this all about

This repository contains code snippets that solve the
code puzzles from http://adventofcode.com/2016, 
whereas I decided to use a different programming language
for every 2 days.

Each day has two puzzles whereas the second one is
a requirements change to the assignment tasked in the 
first one. The second task is only revealed after the first 
has been solved correctly.

Note that the code as it is here will always target to solve
the second riddle of the day, although I tried to keep it
as abstract as possible.
Check the commit history of a file/folder for solutions
to the first of a day's pair of assignments.
